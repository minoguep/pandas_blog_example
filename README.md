The code/data within this repository support the examples discussed in [my blog post](https://paulminogue.com/index.php/2020/01/12/data-integration-transformation-and-visualisation-using-pandas/)

Feel free to download, run, and play around with this code to gain a better understanding of some of the key pandas
methods.
